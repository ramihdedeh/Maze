# Maze Project

## Introduction

The Maze Project is an application designed to create and solve mazes using various algorithms. The project is built with a focus on efficiency and user interaction, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI). The application provides different maze generation and solving techniques, offering users a robust and interactive way to explore maze algorithms.

## Features

- Generation of mazes using different algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Prim's Algorithm).
- Solving mazes using various pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, A*).
- Interactive GUI for visualizing maze generation and solving processes.(SFML)
- Ability to customize maze size and complexity.
- Option to save and load mazes for later use.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core language for implementing the algorithms and application logic.
- **SFML**: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **CMake**: Build system for managing the build process.
- **Google Test**: Testing framework for unit tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++17 or higher
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- SFML 2.6.1 or higher

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramihdedeh/Maze.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Maze
   ```

3. **Create a build directory and navigate into it**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the application using Dev-C++:

1. **Open Dev-C++** and load the project by opening the main C++ file (e.g., `main.cpp`).
2. At the top menu bar, click on the **"Execute"** option.
3. From the dropdown, select **"Compile & Run"** to build and execute the application.
